        <h2>Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)</h2>

        <div class="col-8 d-flex align-items-center"><p><b>Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)</b> are linear periodic anionic polysaccharides playing a key role in the
        extracellular matrix via interactions with a manifold of proteins such as growth factors and chemokines and so
        representing promising targets in artificial matrix engineering for potential applications in regenerative
        medicine.
        Computationally, these molecules are challenging due to their high flexibility, particular
        sulfation pattern (“sulfation code”), importance of the solvent- and ion-mediated interactions, sugar ring
        conformational diversity, periodicity, multipose binding propensity and preference of binding to the long
        and flexible positively charged residues on the protein surface. In addition, when compared with other
        classes of molecules, there is a lack of specific computational approaches to effectively treat protein-GAG
        systems. In our group, we study different aspects of GAG-containing systems in silico and contribute to
        the development of GAG-specific computational approaches. Many ongoing projects in the group are
            carried out within collaborations <a href="{% url 'collaborations' %}">
                with other experimental and theoretical groups</a>.</p></div>

        <p class="col-8 d-flex align-items-center">GAGs are able to bind numerous proteins in the extracellular matrix and so
        modulate their activity. However, often the application of the experimental techniques alone does not
        allow to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying these GAG-driven processes. We have
        established and tested a set of computational approaches based on molecular docking and molecular
        dynamics techniques, which could be successfully used for characterization of protein-GAG interactions
        in particular systems to complement, support and rationalize available experimental data. We have
        observed the dependence of protein-GAG interactions on GAG net sulfation, type and length. GAGs can
        be involved in the interactions of their protein targets with their receptors by different mechanisms:
        directly blocking receptor binding sites; shifting probability distributions in conformational ensemble of

        the protein influencing, in turn, the probability of binding the receptor; repulsing receptors via long-
        ranged electrostatic interactions; supporting interactions via formation of sandwich structures;

        predetermining the sequence of binding events in protein tertiary complexes.</p>

and understanding the data contributing to the knowledge of molecular aspects of GAG interactions with
drug molecules, which would potentially add to the comprehension of molecular pathways involved in  their biological actions.

    <h2>The role of ions</h2>

<div class="row"><div class="col-4"> <img class="float-sm-right m-3" src="{% static 'images/ions.png' %}" alt=""></div>
<p class="col-8 d-flex align-items-center">Specific binding and structural modifications caused by divalent ions on GAGs have
been experimentally described for years. At the same time, there are just few attempts known up-to-date
aimed at analyzing these interactions computationally. In addition to the effects on GAGs, divalent ions
represent a decisive factor in many protein-GAG interactions, by their direct participation in the
intermolecular interface or by changing the electrostatic properties of the protein surface or by influencing
the conformational properties of GAGs. We aim to elucidate the potential mechanisms of
interactions in these particularly challenging multicomponent systems made up of proteins, GAGs and
ions.</p>

    <h2>Specificity of GAG interactions</h2>

     <img class="float-sm-left m-3" src="{% static 'images/spec2.png' %}" alt=""></div>
<div class="col-8 d-flex align-items-center"><p >Among many challenges in GAG modeling, there is one question
which is central in the field that remains unanswered:
    how specific are protein-GAG interactions? For several protein-GAG systems, it was shown that the alterations in the GAG type and
sulfation pattern changes their protein binding capabilities specifically, whereas for others, it is
demonstrated that the only parameter that affects the strength of such interactions is a GAG charge, and
so these interactions are completely driven by electrostatics being, therefore, unspecific. However, there
are no systematic studies dealing with the question of protein-GAG specificity. Moreover, the very
concept of specificity often seems to be very unspecific itself. Together with the NMR research group of
    <a href="https://biophysik.medizin.uni-leipzig.de/forschungresearch/prof-dr-daniel-huster/">Prof. Huster</a>
    (Leipzig University) we work on this topic to find out to which extent these
highly charged molecules could be specific in terms of particular characteristics of their interactions with
other biomacromolecules.</p>

    <h2>Coarse-grained modeling of GAG-containing systems</h2>

<div class="col-8 d-flex align-items-center"><p>Many biologically relevant processes involving
GAGs require modeling at time and distance scales essentially longer than the ones accessible by
classical all atomic modeling. In these lines, the coarse-grained approach can bring essentially new type
of data related to such processes as protein crowding or GAG-mediated protein/peptide structural
enhancement. Our ongoing studies with the goal to implement GAG molecules within the framework of a
    coarse-grained modeling are performed in tight collaboration with
    <a href="https://liwo.strony.ug.edu.pl/">Prof. Liwo</a> (University of Gdansk)
and his physics-based Unified Coarse-Grained Model force field. In case we succeed, this
extension of the modeling scales will allow for principally new insights into the molecular mechanisms
    steered by the molecular interactions with GAGs within complex and versatile multicomponent systems.</p></div>

        More and more modeling
    approaches with the improved capabilities to treat GAG-containing systems have been appearing in the

    last decades. However, in comparison to small molecules, peptide, proteins and nucleic acids, rigorous
    analysis of these molecules is still in a high demand of further novel GAG-specific computational tools.
    In our group we are focused on modification and construction of new GAG-specific molecular docking
    approaches and free energy calculation schemes that would advance in terms of predictive power for
    these systems.
