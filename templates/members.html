                <h2>Sergey Samsonov</h2>
                <h4>Group Leader</h4>
                <p>Sergey Samsonov graduated in Biophysics at Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic             University (Russia) in 2006. In his MSc Thesis he applied experimental and computational methodology to             characterize a potential copper transporter. He obtained his first             <a href="https://tud.qucosa.de/landing-page/?tx_dlf[id]=https%3A%2F%2Ftud.qucosa.de%2Fapi%2Fqucosa%253A25146%2Fmets">PhD</a>             in 2009 in Bioinformatics at Dresden University of Technology in the group of Structural Bioinformatics under             the supervision of Dr. M. Teresa Pisabarro, where he investigated the impact of solvent and effects of             fluorination in protein-protein interactions. In 2010 he obtained his second PhD title in the field of             Biochemistry at St. Petersburg University for the continuation of his Master Thesis topic on copper             metabolism proteins. Since then and until 2017 he was a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Structural             Bioinformatics at Dresden University of Technology within the project             <a href="https://research.uni-leipzig.de/trr67/en/home/">“Transregio 67: Functional biomaterials             for controlling healing processes in bone and skin tissue – from material to clinic”</a>, where he started             to work in the field of modeling             GAG containing biomolecular systems. In 2017 he received a joint grant from National Centre of Sciences             (Poland) and EU Commission within <a href="https://ncn.gov.pl/polonez?language=en">POLONEZ Programme</a> to start his             own research group at the University of Gdańsk. In 2018 he obtained the title of dr hab. at the University             of Tours (France) (Habilitation à diriger des recherches). In 2019, he received two new grants from National             Centre of Sciences (Poland), one of which is within collaborative Programme with German Research Council,             both of which represent extension of his GAG modeling studies. His research interests are in approaching             the understanding of various aspects of GAG interactions with other biomacromolecules and development of             specific methodology for this class of polysaccharides with the assistance of molecular docking,           molecular dynamics, free energy calculations and quantum chemistry approaches.</p>

                <h2>Martyna Maszota-Zieleniak</h2>
                <h4>Postdoctoral Researcher</h4>
                <p>Martyna Maszota-Zieleniak graduated in Environmental Science at Faculty of Chemistry, University of Gdańsk in 2008. In her MSc Thesis she used NMR approaches as well as molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the structure of the Aβ peptide. She completed her PhD in 2017 in Chemistry at Faculty of Chemistry, University of Gdańsk in the Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry under the supervision of dr hab. Sylwia Rodziewicz-Motowidło. The aim of her doctoral dissertation was to supplement the current state of knowledge about structure and interactions between amyloid proteins. She used 1-,2- and 3-D NMR techniques, molecular dynamics calculations in AMBER and structure predictions on the basis of amino acid sequences. During her PhD studies she was working in three independent projects: “Solution NMR investigations of human cystatin C - structure, dynamics and protein-ligand interactions (head of the project)”; “Molecular characteristics of the human cystatin C complex with natural auto-antibodies” (co-investigator); “Design of BTLA protein inhibitors as new anti-melanoma drugs” (co-investigator). She also completed an internship at the National Institute of Chemistry, Slovenian NMR Centre, Ljubljana, Slovenia (2011).

                <h4>Postdoctoral Research Fellow</h4>
                <p>Anila completed her Master's (MSc) in Chemistry from Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam (Kerala,
India) in 2016. She obtained the CSIR-UGC Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) in 2016 and joined CSIR -
National Institute For Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (NIIST), Thiruvananthapuram (Kerala,
India) for her doctoral study under the supervision of Dr. C. H. Suresh. She earned her PhD in Science
under the faculty of Chemical sciences from the Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR),
India in 2022. Her PhD thesis entitled “Density Functional Theory Studies on Transition Metal Fulleride
Complexes and CO2 Capture by Anions, Fullerides, and N-rich Molecular System’’ mainly focuses on the
interaction of CO2 with different anions, imines and fulleride systems using density functional theory
(DFT). During her PhD she investigated the influence of positive cooperativity resulting from the
secondary interactions in the formation of large CO2

clusters around anions and with N-rich systems

(guanidine/imines). Her doctoral studies also involve the possibility of the formation of imidazolium-
based ionic complexes of anionic and polyanionic fullerides and their application as potent CO2 capture

agents. In addition, she also evaluated the coordinating ability of endohedral and exohedral fullerides to
act as η
5
-ligands towards various metal centres to form different organometallic complexes. Currently
Anila is a postdoctoral researcher with Dr. Sergey Samsonov at the Department of Theoretical Chemistry,
University of Gdansk.</p>

His laboratory work on his Master Thesis titled “Expression and purification of RAD50 Zink Hook domain fragments” focused on protein expression for crystallography and NMR. He used various techniques such as circular dichroism, fluorymetry, mass spectrometry, peptide synthesis, spectroscopy, chromatography. In 2017 he qualified to a Visiting Research Graduate Traineeship Program, an internship organized by University of Virginia and Fulbright. During this internship he focused on Electron Microscopy (Negative Stain Microscopy and CryoEM). After a year of the internship in Virginia he stayed there as a Lab Specialist for additional half a year. In 2019 he came back to Poland to start his PhD on University of Gdańsk where he joined Samsonov’s group.</p>
