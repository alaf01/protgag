        <p >GAG Computational Group was established in 2017 when Sergey Samsonov started his
            independent research within the grant project
            <a href={% url 'polonez' %}>Computational approaches to study protein-glycosaminoglycan interactions</a></p>
        <p >In our group, at the <a href="https://chemia.ug.edu.pl/">Faculty of Chemistry, University of Gda≈Ñsk</a>, we apply computational tools to analyze properties of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs),
            negatively charged sulfated periodic polysaccharides,
            and develop new approaches to study the GAG-containing biomolecular systems more effectively.
            Our work advances the basic understanding of these particularly
            challenging biologically relevant molecules required for developing
            novel GAG-mediated tissue regeneration strategies. </p>
